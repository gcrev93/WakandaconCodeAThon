Welcome to Shuri's Room: The Official Code-A-Thon Wakandacon hosted by Gabrielle Crevecoeur [(@NoWaySheCodes)](www.nowayshecodes.com)! The purpose of this room is for people of all ages and skill level to come in and learn something new. These workshops are self-led and are meant to allow you to work on your own time. Best part is, the more workshops you do, the more prizes you can get (try to do enough to get you raffle tickets for the BIG prizes).

### How it works:
1. Get a workshop booklet
    - Your booklet will be used to track the number of workshops you come
2. Select a focus
    - Below you will see 4 major technology focuses. Choose one that interests you and choose a workshop that fits your level.
    - Don't feel like you need to stick to one focus; feel free to hop around
3. Complete a workshop!
    - Do as many workshops as you would like
    - Everytime you complete a workshop, make sure you get a stamp!!

Please note: Many of the workshop links do require you to sign up **(EVERYTHING IS FREE)**. But having an account will allow you to revisit workshops you like after the conference.

### Rewards:

Feel free to ask volunteers if you have any questions about the content below.
